# Aim: 


Submitting homoework is done through github. Make a public repo, then add it as a submodule.

Make sure not to use `git add *` or `git add .` to avoid needing a fancy .gitignore and stuff.

Add your submodule outside of class, to prevent merge conflicts.

* Clone the repository, cd into your period. 

* Get link to your repo, then `git submodule add https://your.repo/ {last name}{First letter of first name}`
