`%x` gives you hex output  `%o` gives octal
## Bitwise Operators
Evaluated on each invidiual bit of a value.

example:

* >> right shift, ex. `x >> 1` will move all bits to the right and add 0s in the front

i.e. cb = cb >> 1

* >> left shift, ex, `x << 2` moves everything to the left, adds 0s in the back. Operators will not overflow!

* negation, ex. `~x` will flip every bit
* or, ex. `a | b` perform or for each pair of bits in (a,b)
* xor, `a ^ b`
