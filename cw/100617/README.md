# Aim: Finding your type

`char s[] = "hello; strcat(s....` is problematic beause theres only 6 characters  ! ! ! 

`typedef` provides a new name for an existing data type

i.e.

```c
typedef <real type> <new map>;
typedef unsigned long size_t;
size_t x = 139;
print("sizeof: %l\]tvalue:%lu\n", sizeof(st), st);

typedef short 
```
size_t is in <stdlib>

IMPORTANT: LINUS'S STYLE GUIDE


Actual class material:

Struct--create a new tpye that is a collection of values.

`struct {int a; char x;} s`, s is a variable of that type

You can make a prototype for this kind of struct, to be used laterL

```c
struct foo {int a;char x;};
struct foot {int a; char x;}  gnag;
struct foo s;

struct woo {
    int a;
    char x;
};
```
