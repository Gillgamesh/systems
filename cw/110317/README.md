# Aim: somethingsomething fget input

* Filesizes are in BYTES not bits
* For the fancy ls, you wanna do it bitwise, using `&`

Command line arguments:

int main(int argc, char *argv[]);

BUt what about live input:

* scanf- <stdio.h>
* reads in data from stdin using the format string to determine types
* puts the data in each variable
* variables must be pointers
* if they dont match, then u have problems
