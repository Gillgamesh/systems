## Aim: Hello World!

### DN: Hello World program in C, compile it

`./a.out` is equal to doing `/usr/bin/ls`, just specifies the directory the command is run from

`echo $PATH`

`a.out` doesn't work because it's not in any of the bash path areas


#### About C:
Developed in 70s by Dennis Ritchie while working on UNIX. Designed to match closely with machine level instructions, making the resulting programs lean and fast.

Also allowed same source to be compiled on different machines.

Procedural language (NOT OOP)
