## Do Now: Turn o neighbors and discuss the things thtat came up while you were wokring on the euler assignment. What did you find suprising, confusing, helpful, or harmful?

* Loop declarations
* Array declarations: `int var[n]`
* YOU NEED TO DECLARE VALUES FOR VARIABLES EVEN IF ITS 0
* vars can be declared like this: `int a=3,b=6`
* character literals are inside '', ie 'a', '*'
* there are String literals, i.e. "hello"
* Function order matters!
* You cannnot redeclare functions !!
* unsigned = posiitve only


### Memory Management:

Memory allocation either happens at compile time or at run time (dynamic).

Compiler Allocated Memory: Packaged with the binary of the program
There is no standard default value to save system time
